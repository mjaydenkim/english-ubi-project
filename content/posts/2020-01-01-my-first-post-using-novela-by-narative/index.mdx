# What is Universal Basic Income?
Universal Basic Income is a type of social security in which the government provides money to every citizen in the governed population regardless of income, work, or class. The idea has been touted by Thomas Paine at the founding of the country, Richard Nixon (who later turned against it), Abraham Lincoln, Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Andrew Yang who is a Democrat running for president in 2020. Yang's plan, called the Fredom Dividend, if put into effect, would give $1000 to every American over the age of 18.
